## **Project Overview**

The global economy heavily relies on the transport industry, a pivotal element in facilitating the efficient movement of goods. The seamless transportation of products is essential for businesses to function optimally and for customers to receive their orders punctually. Nevertheless, determining the most suitable mode of transport for each shipment poses a complex challenge. This decision involves evaluating various factors, including the nature of the product, distance to be covered, and the final destination.

The choice of the appropriate transport mode significantly impacts the delivery time, cost, and safety of the transported goods. For instance, air transport generally offers quicker delivery but at a higher cost compared to other modes, whereas sea transport, though slower, proves more cost-effective for larger shipments. A misjudgment in the selection of the transport mode can lead to delays, damage to goods, or increased operational costs for businesses. Accurately predicting the optimal transport mode for each shipment enables businesses to streamline their logistics operations, minimize costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.
